## Documentation

What do we do in each learning path

### 1. Machine Learning
- Collect the dataset from Kaggle
- Preprocessing the dataset
- Implement augmentation such as rotation, flip, contrast, zoom using Tensorflow and color manually with OpenCV
- Build the model with transfer learning and convert it to TensorFlow Lite

### 2. Cloud Computing
- Creating virtual machine as backend server in GCP.
- Setting databases
- Creating several APIs of communication in the backend and mobile apps 
- Implementing Google Web Client ID

### 3. Mobile Development
- Designing the UI/UX
- Implement  retrofit to retrieve data from API and send data to database through API
- Using shared preference for saving state and save data from API responses
- Implement cameraX
- Implement maps and location features using Google Maps API
- Generating QR code from ID that got from API for confirmation state
